# ShashankToken (SST) – Full ERC-20 Demo
A complete demo implementation of an ERC-20 token using OpenZeppelin, built and deployed using Remix IDE.

🚀 Project Overview

ShashankToken (SST) is a fully functional ERC-20 token deployed on the Ethereum/Polygon testnets.
This project demonstrates:

1. ERC-20 token creation
2. Minting & burning tokens
3. Transferring tokens (public & owner-only)
4. Using predefined wallet addresses
5. Using OpenZeppelin’s secure smart-contract standards

The contract is written in Solidity 0.8.20 and uses the ERC20 and Ownable modules.
